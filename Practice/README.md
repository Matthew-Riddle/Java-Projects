# Snow
A particle snow simulation. It just makes a pretty snow effect for now. You can change the direction of the snow with W A S D. For now the only direction that does not bug out is the left direction. I capped it, but the other 3 directions will get some pretty crazy effects and possibly crash since i did not cap the speed that you can move the snow.
